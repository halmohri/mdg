# Misery Digraphs: Delaying Attacks in Obscure Clouds. 
The home for misery digraphs, securing your cloud by making the attacker's life miserable.
This is a research project that aims at increasing the number of steps an attacker needs to penetrate a remote attack into an internal cloud network hoping for reaching a target asset. The current version of attack graphs achieve this by increasing attack steps from three up to thousands of repeated steps. 

Misery digraphs primarly focus on basic technologies provided both by AWS and Google Cloud Platform. However, few assumptions are made on the very specific technologies provided by either vendor.
